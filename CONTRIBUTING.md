   ```

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
# Update your main branch
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b bugfix/issue-number-description
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Follow our coding standards (see below)
- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Test your changes thoroughly
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run shellcheck on scripts
shellcheck deploy-netbird-selfhosted.sh
shellcheck install.sh

# Test deployment in a controlled environment
# (Use Hetzner Cloud test account if available)
./deploy-netbird-selfhosted.sh --dry-run

# Test installation script
./install.sh
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Follow conventional commit standards:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add support for custom server locations"
# or
git commit -m "fix: resolve OAuth callback 404 issue"
# or
git commit -m "docs: update Azure AD setup guide"
```

#### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a pull request on GitHub with:
- Clear title and description
- Reference to related issues
- Screenshots or logs (if applicable)
- Checklist of changes made

## üìù Coding Standards

### Bash Scripting Guidelines

1. **Use set -e** for error handling:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   set -e
   ```

2. **Quote variables** to prevent word splitting:
   ```bash
   echo "Hello, $USER"
   rm -rf "$TEMP_DIR"
   ```

3. **Use functions** for reusable code:
   ```bash
   print_status() {
       echo -e "${BLUE}[INFO]${NC} $1"
   }
   ```

4. **Check command existence**:
   ```bash
   if ! command -v docker >/dev/null 2>&1; then
       print_error "Docker is not installed"
       exit 1
   fi
   ```

5. **Use meaningful variable names**:
   ```bash
   # Good
   SERVER_TYPE="cax11"
   DOMAIN_NAME="nb.example.com"
   
   # Bad
   ST="cax11"
   DN="nb.example.com"
   ```

### Documentation Guidelines

1. **Use clear headings** with emoji for better readability
2. **Include code examples** with proper syntax highlighting
3. **Provide context** for why something is needed
4. **Update relevant sections** when making changes
5. **Use consistent formatting** throughout

### Configuration Files

1. **Use comments** to explain complex configurations
2. **Follow YAML/JSON standards** for formatting
3. **Validate syntax** before committing
4. **Use environment variables** for customizable values

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing

1. **Test on clean environment**: Use fresh Ubuntu 24.04 installation
2. **Test different scenarios**:
   - New installation
   - Upgrade from previous version
   - Custom configuration options
   - Error conditions

3. **Validate Azure AD integration**:
   - SPA configuration
   - OAuth flow
   - Token exchange
   - User management

### Automated Testing

1. **Shellcheck validation**: All scripts must pass shellcheck
2. **Syntax validation**: YAML/JSON files must be valid
3. **Link checking**: Documentation links must work
4. **Integration tests**: Core functionality must work end-to-end
